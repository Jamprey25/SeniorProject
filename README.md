(ClubHub App Overview

App Goal
To create an iOS app for student organizations at Sidwell Friends School to advertise themselves, share announcements, and engage the student body more effectively. (If possible expand to other schools)

The Problem
The current system for student clubs at Sidwell is disorganized and outdated.
Club-related announcements are often buried in general school emails.


Students don’t have access to club histories, past events, or leadership information.


Outside of the club fair at the beginning of the school year, there is no clear way to discover or interact with clubs.
Clubs also don’t have a space to show their accomplishments 



The Solution
My senior Projects offer a centralized digital hub where students can explore clubs, receive updates, and engage with school organizations all from their phones. Club leaders and school admins also gain tools to manage their organizations more effectively.
